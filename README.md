Choose the folder that corresponds with the OS that you want to make a bootable iso from, check the readme files for the requirements for each, run the scripts, and enjoy

**NOTE**
The scripts are currently only compatible with Linux operating systems, as the mount command does not run the same way on MacOS systems despite the similar command line. If you don't have a linux system installed you can quickly do a minimal install of ubuntu or centOS and run the script there from the command line. 

Enjoy!
